            <h4>PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
            <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Block109, we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
            <p>
              We are thoughtful about the personal information we ask you to provide and the personal information that we collect about you through the operation of our services.<br />
              We store personal information for only as long as we have a reason to keep it.<br />
              We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what information on you is shared publicly (or kept private), indexed by search engines, and permanently deleted.<br />
              We aim for full transparency on how we gather, use, and share your personal information.<br />
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Who We Are and What This Policy Covers</strong><br />
              We are Block 109. We are the organisation which owns block109.co.uk
            </p>
            <p>This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect about you when you use:</p>
            <p>
              Our websites (including block109.co.uk)<br />
              Purchase and use products from us via the websites or by telephone.<br />
              Throughout this Privacy Policy we’ll refer to our website, products and services collectively as ‘Services.‘
            </p>
            <p>Below we explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that you have with respect to that.</p>
            <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any of our products or services that have a separate privacy policy.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please use the contact form from anywhere on our websites.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Information We Collect</strong><br />
              We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so–for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better.
            </p>
            <p>We collect information in three ways: when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our services, and from outside sources. Let’s go over the information that we collect.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong><br />
              Basic Account Information: We will ask for basic information in order for you to become a member of Block109. We will also require an email address to contact you.
