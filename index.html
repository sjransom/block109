        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>Block 109 was created by Kunal Sapat in 2018 following England’s World Cup campaign that ended with semi-final defeat to Croatia is Moscow. The purpose was to capture the fantastic atmosphere created in Russia, and continually on the road throughout Europe and across the globe and bring it back to Wembley Stadium.</p>
        <p>While COVID-19 has delayed many of our plans, much has been achieved in 2020. Meetings with The FA saw us allocated a group booking of tickets for each home match, to bring as many people as possible together to raise the noise levels at Wembley.</p>
        <p>Despite the absence of supporters, Block 109 have continued to create banners and supply flags for the stadium to ensure the arena has looked as colourful and homely as possible for Gareth Southgate’s Three Lions.</p>
        <p>Block 109 run coaches to and from away games from airports and neighbouring cities and other excursions such as a “Boat n Beer” river excursion planned for Budapest ahead of our World Cup Qualifier in September. </p>
        <p>During the pandemic our fundraising has enabled us to donate over £1000 to both CALM and NHS Charities, amongst other smaller donations to other causes and charities. Fundraising events include a monthly prize draw, sweepstakes, competitions and other events.</p>
